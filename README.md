# Augmented-Reality
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that enhances the real world with virtual information, objects, or environments, blending digital content with the physical world.

Augmented Reality Website

📌 Project Overview

This is a Web-based Augmented Reality (AR) project developed for the BCA 1st Semester curriculum.
The website allows users to experience interactive AR content directly through their device’s camera without installing any extra software.
It is designed to demonstrate the practical application of AR.js and Three.js in web development.

🎯 Objectives

To understand and implement Augmented Reality in a web environment.

To explore WebXR and AR.js for browser-based AR.

To develop an interactive, user-friendly interface for displaying 3D objects in the real world.

To showcase how AR can be used in education, entertainment, and business.



🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

AR.js – For AR rendering in browsers.

Three.js – For 3D model display and interaction.

WebXR API – For AR/VR device integration.
